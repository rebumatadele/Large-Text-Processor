Reorganize the provided text into a markdown structure with headers and subheaders. Under each subheader, use bullet points to separate individual sentences or complete thoughts from the original text. Do not summarize, paraphrase, or alter the original text in any way. Each bullet point should contain the exact words from the transcript, preserving all original phrasing, including filler words, repetitions, and informal language. The goal is to maintain 100% of the original content while improving readability through organization.
